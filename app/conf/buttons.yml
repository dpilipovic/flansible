# This is a place to configure all of your buttons. Each button/operation has 4 required key-value pairs: button_name, button_description, _cmd and _id.
# In adition there is an optional value of: api
# button_name is the name that will be shown in the button on the home page
# button_description is the description for this action that will show up next to the button on the home page
# _id is the most important configuration parameter. It should be a unique alpabetical value without any spaces. It is passed to each operation, and according to _id value commands are triggered.
# _id also has a secondary purpose that it is the API call endpoint - post calls will execute the playbooks via API call and GET calls will describe/list details about it from this same file.
# _cmd is the ansible comand as you would run it on ansible server
# api is optional if api: 'True' API call for thise _id will be ebabled, otherwise it is disabled.
